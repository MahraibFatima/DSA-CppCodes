### Choosing the Most Efficient Algorithm
This document analyzes the running times of three different algorithms and recommends the most efficient one for a problem of size n.

## Algorithms

### Algorithm A:
Divides the problem into `5` subproblems of size `n/2`.
Solves each subproblem recursively.
Combines solutions in linear time `(O(n))`.

### Algorithm B:
Divides the problem into `2` subproblems of size `n-1`.
Solves each subproblem recursively.
Combines solutions in constant time `(O(1))`.

### Algorithm C:
Divides the problem into `9` subproblems of size `n/3`.
Solves each subproblem recursively.
Combines solutions in `O(n^2)` time.

## Time Complexity Analysis

### Algorithm A 
The divide-and-conquer approach with linear time combination suggests a running time of `O(n log n)`.

### Algorithm B
The recurrence relation `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + O(1)` leads to an exponential time complexity, `O(2^n)`.

### Algorithm C

The recurrence relation `T(n) = 9T(n/3) + O(n^2)` also results in exponential time complexity, potentially `O(n^(log 9))`.

## Solution

`Algorithm A` is the most efficient choice with a time complexity of `O(n log n)`. The constant factor (5) in its recurrence relation doesn't affect the overall growth rate compared to the exponential complexities of Algorithm B and C.

Therefore, for problems of size n, `Algorithm A` is the recommended approach due to its superior efficiency.
